# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any Simple IRC Client repository, please report it responsibly.

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) by going to the **Security** tab of the affected repository and clicking **Report a vulnerability**.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a resolution timeline within 5 business days.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the latest release only.
